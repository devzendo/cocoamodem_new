cocoamodem
==========

cocoaModem is a Mac OS X application which implements modems (modulator-demodulators) for some of the Amateur Radio modulation modes. cocoaModemâ€™s name is a reference to the MacOS X Cocoa framework that it uses. 

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/redpola/cocoamodem_new with the
aim of getting cocoaModem building and working correctly on macOS Catalina.
